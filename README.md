## Hotel Types
I decided to look at the first column to see which hotel types are chosen the most. In this data set, there are only two kinds: Resort Hotels and City Hotels

It seems that this data set contains more resort hotel bookings over city hotel bookings. My intution tells me that I think there will be a trend in the meal plan chosen along with the hotel type. I can imagine that maybe BB is more common amongst Resort Hotels just because I would assume people at Resorts would leave do to "vacationy" activies throughout the day.

So BB is chosen by far the most of all meal type, which is no surprise. Other than kind of applying the same thought process that I spoke of in the hotel types visualization to all the different meal types , I don't think there is anymore more to say here.
